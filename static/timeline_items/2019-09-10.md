Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, sends a letter to Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire requesting the whistleblower complaint.

> "We do not know whether this decision to withhold the disclosure was made only by you, or whether it involved interference by other parties, including the White House. The Committee's recent experience has heightened concern of improper White House efforts to influence your offie and the Intelligence Community. The failure to transmit to the Committee an urgent and credible whistleblower complaint, as required by law, raises the prospect than an urgent matter of a serious nature is being purposefully concealed from the Committee."
