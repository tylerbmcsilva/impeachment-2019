Kurt Volker, President Trump’s form Special Envoy to Ukraine, testifies before Congress. Volker provides text messages between himself and other officials.

The chairs of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform Committees released [text messages](https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/a/4/a4a91fab-99cd-4eb9-9c6c-ec1c586494b9/621801458E982E9903839ABC7404A917.chairmen-letter-on-state-departmnent-texts-10-03-19.pdf) between Kurt Volker, Gordon Sondland, and Andriy Yermak. The messages revealed that President Trump would not meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until Ukraine publicly committed to the investigations sought out by The White House.

One key exchange is between Bill Taylor, a top US Diplomat in Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the EU:

> [9/9/19, 12:47:11 AM] Bill Taylor: "As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign."

_5 hours later, after speaking to President Trump_

> [9/9/19, 5:19:35 AM] Gordon Sondland: Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump’s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo’s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Volodymyr Zelensky promised during his campaign I suggest we stop the back and forth by text If you still have concerns I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or S a call to discuss them directly. Thanks.
