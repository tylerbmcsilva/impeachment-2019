Shortly after Marie L. Yovanovitch starts her assignment as US Ambassador to Ukraine, she approaches Yuriy Lutsenko, Prosecutor General of Ukraine, to discuss how many of his officers are corrupt and to cease investigations into anti-corruption activists supported by the American Embassy.

Lutsenko recalls his response was, "No one is going to dictate to me."

After this heated exchange, Yovanovitch increases her criticism of the investigations and Lutsenko's frustration grows, causing him to seek out someone who will listen: The Trump Administration.
