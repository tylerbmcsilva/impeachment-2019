The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence releases the transcript from the deposition of George Kent, Assistant Secretary in the European and Eurasian Bureau at the U.S. Department of State.

> "[Ambassador] Gordon [Sondland], had talked to the President, POTUS in sort of shorthand, and POTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go to microphone and say investigations, Biden, and Clinton"

> "I do not believe the U.S. should ask other countries to engage in politically associated investigations and prosecutions. ... As a general principle, I don’t think that as a matter of policy the U.S. should do that period, because I have spent much of my career trying to improve the rule of law. And in countries like Ukraine and Georgia, both of which want to join NATO, both of which have enjoyed billions of dollars of assistance from Congress, there is an outstanding issue about people in office in those countries using selectively politically motivated prosecutions to go after their opponents. And that’s wrong for the rule of law regardless of what country that happens."
