The Trump Administration prevents Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the European Union, from testifying to a congressional impeachment hearing.

Pat A. Cipollone, Counsel to the President, sent a letter to Congress stating that the White House will be refusing to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. The letter accuses the impeachment inquiry of being partisan and unconstitutional. It also states that any current or former State Department are duty-bound to protect the confidentiality of the Executive Branch.
