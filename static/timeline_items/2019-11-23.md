Gordon Sondland, US Ambasaador to the European Union, testifies in a public hearing.

> First, Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker and I worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the President of the United States. We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani.

> Fourth, as I testified previously, Mr. Giulianiâ€™s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky.

> I shared concerns of the potential quid pro quo regarding the security aid with Senator Ron Johnson. And I also shared my concerns with the Ukrainians.
