William B. Taylor, US Envoy to Ukraine, testifies before Congress. His testimony is the first to implicate President Trump directly in regards to quid pro quo.

> In an instant I realized one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened.

> Very concerned, on that same day I sent Ambassador Sondland a text message asking if "we [are] now saying that security assistance and [a] WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?" Ambassador Sondland responded asking me to call him, which I did. During that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelenskyy to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
>
> Ambassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President Zelenskyy was dependent on a public announcement of investigations - in fact, Ambassador Sondland said, "everything" was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance. He said that President Trump wanted President Zelenskyy "in a public box" by making a public statement about ordering such investigations."
