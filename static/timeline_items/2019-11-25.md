A federal judge issus a preliminary injunction ordering the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Defence to comply with the Freedom of Information Act request for all documents related to why there was a freeze on security aide to Ukraine.

* First half of documents must be released by 12 December, 2019
* Second half of documents must be released by 20 December, 2019

> "Currently, the United States House of Representatives is in the process of conducting impeachment proceedings concerning the same subject matter as the documents requested by Plaintiff. As such, the requested documents are sought in order to inform the public on a matter of extreme national concern. Only an informed electorate can develop its opinions and persuasively petition its elected officials to act in ways which further the aims of those opinions."

A federal judge rules that Don McGahn, former White House counsel, must comply with the subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee citing there is no basis for the claim the White House staff are ”absolutely immune from congressional testimony.”

> "When DOJ insists that Presidents can lawfully prevent their senior-level aides from responding to compelled congressional process and that neither the federal courts nor Congress has the power to do anything about it, DOJ promotes a conception of separation-of-powers principles that gets these constitutional commands exactly backwards. In reality, it is a core tenet of this Nation’s founding that the powers of a monarch must be split between the branches of the government to prevent tyranny."

> "[I]f a duly authorized committee of Congress issues a valid legislative subpoena to a current or former senior-level presidential aide, the law requires the aide to appear as directed, and assert executive privilege as appropriate."
