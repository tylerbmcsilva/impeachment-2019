The Committee on House Oversight and Reform issues a subpoena to the White House Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, requesting any and all documents related to the impeachment inquiry by 18 October, 2019.

> "Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the direction or behest of the President or others at the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President"

> "A vote of the full House is not required to launch an impeachment inquiry, and there is no authority for the White house to make this claim. There is no such requirement in the Constitution or in the House Rules."

> “We deeply regret that President Trump has put us — and the nation — in this position, but his actions have left us with no choice but to issue this subpoena.”
