Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, announces that he will be going to Kiev, Ukraine to pressure the Ukrainian government to continue investigations.

> Giuliani: "And this isn’t foreign policy — I’m asking them to do an investigation that they’re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I’m going to give them reasons why they shouldn’t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government."
