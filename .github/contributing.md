# How to contribute

I'm beyond elated you're reading this, this project started as a solo project, and has quickly become fairly robust.

## Testing

Any new components created for should have basic unit tests. Currently I'm working on adding additional missing tests (unless you would like to add those :wink:)

## Submitting changes

Please send a [pull request to impeachment-2019](https://github.com/tylerbmcsilva/impeachment-2019/pull/new/master) with a list of proposed updates.

If submitting new posts or information for the site, please include relevant sources within the body of the pull request (as well as on the post, matching the other posts)

## Coding conventions

Optimize for readability:

  * Indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * Semicolons are necessary
  * Preference for single instead of double quotes
  * Preference for `const` instead of `let` and `var`
  * Preference for named functions
  * Verbose variable names (this helps other contributors understand the necessity of the variable)
  * `map`, `filter`, `reduce` instead of `for`

Thanks,
Tyler McSilva
