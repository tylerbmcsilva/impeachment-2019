Marie Yovanovitch, former US Ambassador to Ukraine, testify in a public hearing.

> I want to reiterate first that the allegation that I disseminated a “Do Not Prosecute” list was a fabrication. Mr. Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian Prosecutor General who made that allegation, has acknowledged that the list never existed.
>
> The Obama administration did not ask me to help the Clinton campaign or harm the Trump campaign, nor would I have taken any such steps if they had. Partisanship of this type is not compatible with the role of a career Foreign Service Officer.

Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, asks Yovanovitch during the hearing for her response in which she states:

> "I actually think that where I've served over the years — I, and others, have demonstrably made things better, you know, for the U.S. as well as for the countries that I've served in."
>
> "It's very intimidating. ... I mean, I can't speak to what the president is trying to do, but I think the effect is trying to be intimidating"
