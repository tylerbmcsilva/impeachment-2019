Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the European Union, testifies before Congress.

From his opening statement:

> "I am **NOT** here to push an agenda. I am here to tell the truth"

> "We were also disappointed by the president’s direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani. Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the president’s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine."

> "Please know that I would not have recommended that Mr. Giuliani or any private citizen be involved in these foreign policy matters. However, given the president’s explicit direction, as well as the importance we attached to arranging a White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, we agreed to do as President Trump directed."

> "I did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani’s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president’s 2020 re-election campaign."

> "Let me state clearly: Inviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S.election would be wrong. Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong. I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings. In my opinion,security aid to Ukraine was in our vital national interest and should not have been delayed for any reason."
