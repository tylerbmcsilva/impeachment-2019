John Bolton, National Security Advisor, has a heated exchange with Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the European Union, over Sondland and Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, pressing Ukraine to "investigate Democrats." 

Fiona Hill, Senior Director of Russian and Eurasian Affairs, is instructed by John Bolton to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council that Rudy Giuliani and Mick Mulveney, acting White House Chief of Staff, were working on a rogue operation.

Fiona Hill later testifies on <a href="#2019-10-14">14 October, 2019</a>.
