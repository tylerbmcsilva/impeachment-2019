Former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie L. Yovanovitch, in defiance of the <a href="#2019-10-08">08 October, 2019</a> letter stating that the Executive Branch would not be cooperating in the impeachment inquiry, testifies in a closed-door session to 3 different committees that President Trump pressured the State Department to remove Yovanovitch from her position on <a href="#2019-05-20">20 May, 2019</a>.

> "Although I understand that I served at the pleasure of the President, I was nevertheless incredulous that the US Government chose to remove an Ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives."
