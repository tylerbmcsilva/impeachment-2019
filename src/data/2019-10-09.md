Compass Rose Legal Group, the law firm representing the multiple whistleblowers, release a statement regarding the alleged "bias" of the whistleblower.

> "First, our client has never worked for or advised a political candidate, campaign, or party."

> "Second, our client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the Executive Branch."

> "To date, virtually every substantive allegation has been confirmed by other sources. For that reason the identity of the whistleblower is irrelevant."
